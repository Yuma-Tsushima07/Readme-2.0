"Hello, to everyone who does not know me, I am just an normal person who does crazy things."
``` 
I am just a regular person who came from the creative community. Technology was around me a lot, when I was younger I used to procrastinate in studies using everything I had.
I jumped into hacking when I OSINTed my best friend who now does not like me anymore. I started to make random games and had crazy ideas of universes which never existed.
Now, having a solid fundamentals of hacking and programming, I blasted into Hack The Box and stepped into the deep end of the sea. With all of my might, using determination, 
resilience and belief. [Triangle of Positivity Reference] I now am an Elite Hacker on Hack The Box!
